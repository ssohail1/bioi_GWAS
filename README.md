Toy Model: Pixieplatin (PxPt) is a new chemotherapeutic agent developed by Faerie Pharmaceuticals. Unfortunately, one of the major side effects of the drug is thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts), which could lead to dangerous internal bleeding. Platelet counts have been measured in 922 individuals of European ancestry after treatment with PxPt. **Perform a GWAS on the platelet count (log-transformed) phenotype.** Genotypes are in PLINK binary format files (`bed/bim/fam`, genome build `hg19`) and phenotypes are in the `PxPt_PLT_counts.txt` file.

Answer the questions about your analysis and embed relevant code and plots into the `.Rmd` file.
